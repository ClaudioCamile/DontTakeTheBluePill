If the web is the center of your life you must be thinking to yourself - how is it that everyone is so nice, happy and smiling, willing to give, always full of energy and motivation, with a wide horizon and vision for the future, leadership and a desire to lead, how is it that on this side of the screen everything looks the other way around? Completely the opposite of what has been said so far?

  Am I just like that?
  
I will not rewrite anything but maybe what I will do write will reveal the truth point in the wholle lie, the truth is that what you see on the net is what and how people would like to see themselves and therefore try to paint a pinkish atmosphere of everything written above, yap, that way we would like to think of ourselves, but this truth point is stuck deep, deep in wholle lie as if and we are already there, it will take sometime to get there, meantime, we have to hold our breath and keep on trying to be like that, you are not alone, everyone feallls like you, they just keepon trying, you too, keepon, don't get-losse, keepon.
